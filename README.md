# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hennadii

Full-stack developer, main stack is **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **React/Next.js**, **Node.js/NestJS** but I also have experience with Python, C#, Unreal Engine 5, and working with various databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.

Currently developing [**StoryFlow Editor**](https://storyflow-editor.com), a visual scripting tool for interactive storytelling that lets non-programmers design branching narratives through intuitive node-based interfaces.
